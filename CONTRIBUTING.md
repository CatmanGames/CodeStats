The codestats plugin is meant as an easy to use plugin for JetBrains IDE's to show statistic centered around written code.

The main focus of this plugin is:
  - Efficiency and Speed
  - Clean and Nice to look at
  - Easy to use, but allow for customization
  - Does what it should do, and nothing more or less

If your changes fit into these general outlines they will probably be merged into the codebase.

Thank you for any additions, reviews or fixes!
